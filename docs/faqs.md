Wonderful to be back with the paper and ink. Spreading though on paper, like cream cheese do on toasty bagel, or perhaps like way an unattended slime mold will take over a dingy basement. Yea, let me take my mind and press it to the page, as six year old might their face to glass, brow jammed hard, nose squished in a porcine orientation, mouth open, lips suctioned air tight, cheeks undergoing a rapid inflation cycle of pirate's monetary policy, tongue writhing like an unattended fire hose, pressing as hard as you can, hoping some passerby with be offended by the ghastly contortion of a human face framed before them. But stepping back, despite your attempts to imprint your very soul into the glass, your efforts a have merely left a Rorschach smear of oil and saliva. Wonderful indeed.
