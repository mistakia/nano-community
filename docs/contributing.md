# Contributing

## Development

Nano has a relatively small community of developers and only a handful of developers employed at the <a href="https://nano.org/en/foundation" target="_blank">Nano Foundation</a>. Therefore, contributions from the community can make a big difference. Start by reviewing the following contributions guides:

- Support the <a href="https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-docs/" target="_blank">official Nano documentation</a>
- Contribute code to the <a href="https://docs.nano.org/node-implementation/contributing/" target="_blank">reference nano node implementation</a>
- Help with <a href="https://docs.nano.org/running-a-node/beta-network/" target="_blank">beta testing</a>

Next, participate in community [discussions](/community), by reading and replying to <a href="https://forum.nano.org/" target="_blank">forum posts</a> and <a href="https://chat.nano.org/" target="_blank">discord messages</a>. This gives you a great insight into the pain points that currently exist with the software.

#### Contribute to the ecosystem

- <a href="https://github.com/mistakia/nano-community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank">Nano.Community</a>: community gateway and knowledge hub
- <a href="https://github.com/Nault/Nault/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank">Nault</a>: a popular community maintained wallet

## Marketing

Before you can effectively contribute to Nano adoption and marketing it is a good idea to have a working understanding of the following:

- [Why it matters](/introduction/why-it-matters)
- [Advantages](/introduction/advantages)
- [Investment Thesis](/introduction/investment-thesis)
- [How it works](/introduction/how-it-works)
- [Misconceptions](/introduction/misconceptions)

Next, you'll want to understand the vision and roadmap so that we all pull in the same direction.

#### Vision, Roadmap & Goals

Nano aims to be a form of money both replacing existing use cases (payments, remittances, donations, etc) and inventing new previously impossible use cases (micropayments, "streaming" value, etc). Thus, use as a system to transfer value is the focus.

Being that Nano is a protocol, to help increase use of the network, it is important to attract entrepeneurs, developers and enthusiasts to help build and improve it. Nano, much like the internet at first, is still hard to use for the vast majority of consumers and businesses. Thus we need builders to make it more accessible so that everyone can use it.

#### Target Audience

##### Speculators / Holders

Why: For Nano to sustain high real world payment volume it needs to be worth something and have enough liquidity. Thus before there is utility, we need speculators and holders. Due to the positive feedback loop of its network effects, the more who are invested, the more attention the project gets, the more businesses are interested in integrating Nano payments, which then attracts even more investors, companies, developers and exchanges continuing the feedback loop.

Pitch: Nano is a strongly undervalued cryptocurrency. Both as a medium of exchange and store of value, it is fundamentally the best there is in the space. As a medium of exchange, Nano being instant, feeless and scalable means that it is hard to imagine something better. As a store of value, Nano's zero inflation, eco-friendliness and game theory leading to ever more decentralization over time make it potentially the best store of value. However, many cryptocurrencies have higher market caps than Nano. If one analyses any other cryptocurrency that claims to be a store of value or medium of exchange, they'll find that Nano is fundamentally better. Because of this, it stands to reason that as the market gets more mature and rational, Nano's recognition and price will increase.

##### Open source developers

##### Exchanges

Why: A currency becomes more useful and valuable when more people own it. The easier it is for people to exchange into Nano, the better. At the same time, the easier it is to sell Nano, the more likely it is that people will use accept Nano payments, knowing they can exchange into fiat easily if they so desire. More exchange listings also leads to a more decentralized network, as the Nano supply becomes more spread out.

Pitch: Nano is interesting both from a direct business and a marketing perspective. In terms of direct business, Nano has a sizeable and growing trading volume. It has clear usecases in being used for payments and remittances. Many of those receiving Nano want to exchange into fiat or other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, many new Nano holders are new to crypto as a whole, and are looking for an exchange to buy Nano on. Nano also has a large and vocal community. Any exchange listing is broadly shared on all sorts of social mediums (Twitter, Reddit) and is one of the best forms of free marketing available.

##### Entrepeneurs

##### Payment Processors

Why: A currency becomes more useful and valuable when there are more places to spend it. As Nano is first and foremost a currency, more merchant acceptance is key. Many merchants use payment processors, hence this being a very important avenue for Nano growth.

Pitch: Nano is a cryptocurrency that is literally made for payments. It's instant and feeless, exposing you to minimal costs and minimal volatility risk. Because of its usability as currency, Nano has built up a large community interested in spending Nano. Adding Nano as a payment option would lead to increased volume, and also a lot of free marketing from Nano enthusiasts recommending your payment processor service to merchants looking to integrate crypto payments.

##### Journalists

Why: Journalists essentially act as an amplifying force of the message we are trying to send out. Our reach is limited, journalists tend to have a larger reach. Nano has strong fundamentals in being meant to make the world a better place through secure payments for all, in an eco-friendly way.

Pitch: Nano is a cryptocurrency that serves to make money more efficient for a more equal world - offering anyone access to secure money. Nano can be transferred instantly and feelessly, and is eco-friendly. It's a green alternative to Bitcoin, that solves many of its issues. Additionally, it was given away for free, since the founder's vision was to improve the world.
