# Contributing

Nano has a relatively small community of developers and only a handful of developers employed at the <a href="https://nano.org/en/foundation" target="_blank">Nano Foundation</a>. Therefore, contributions from the community can make a big difference. Start by reviewing the following contributions guides:

- Support the <a href="https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-docs/" target="_blank">official Nano documentation</a>
- Contribute code to the <a href="https://docs.nano.org/node-implementation/contributing/" target="_blank">reference nano node implementation</a>
- Help with <a href="https://docs.nano.org/running-a-node/beta-network/" target="_blank">beta testing</a>

Next, participate in the community [discussions](/community), by following along on <a href="https://chat.nano.org/" target="_blank">discord</a>. This gives you great insight into the pain points that currently exist with the project.

### Contribute to the ecosystem
