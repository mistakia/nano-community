That's it, I'm out. This coin will be dumped upon by private dev and non-dev wallets for years to come and NF has done enough weird things with investors money for my taste. I'm sodling today, see you dudes. Gonna check every once in a while how womenInTech and Appia are doing.

I will just make things straight since people are lying about me here (Indigone, rob)...

I left because I'm out of Nano and I don't see it regaining any momentum, especially with the dev fund running out. The competition is increasing and Nano is starting to get behind tech-wise. Nano had its chance of increasing the awareness and the community, but that failed and I think it's too late now. The community is shrinking and people are leaving, and I don't see that trend change. The community was great at some point, but has become quite toxic lately, which is very sad to see and not rewarding at all.

I don't talk badly about Nano on Avax Telegram, or anywhere else. Those are just lies by Indigone, as other lies he spreading about me. I guess it's fine to spread lies here... Nano hasn't been a big part of my portfolio for a long time, so I'm fine financial-wise. Always own BTC and ETH.

The contract of my hosting provider ends March-April next year, so I will run repnode until then, at least. But I don't want repnode to gain any more weight, which is why I asked json to remove repnode as default rep in Nault.

I hope that I'm wrong about Nano's future, but I will be standing on the sidelines until the sentiment significantly change. I wish you all the best and that you succeed with your investments. Cheers!

After 1 week of using this discord I've realised its basically just a chatroom full of people with nothing better to do than wait for the price to move. All you'll see here is a load of monkeys shouting 'wen moon' & '$2 tuesdays'. Meaningful discussions are none existent.
Don't even get me started on the tips, you're all throwing dust at eachother

I'm out, goodbye.

Im going to be that guy who pulls out of crypto for now. This tether drama, uncertainty about the 4 million Bitgrail Trustee and generally high price for Nano and Bitcoin just does not feel right in my gut. I will still be around, but just wish you all safety with your money :blush:

It is pretty interesting how that whale who just bought the 350,000 Nano on Binance was an old whale that sold his last 100,000 Nano's around 20k Sats back in August 2018 just before the huge pump.  This is the first wallet transfer since then.  My guess is he stayed all in Bitcoin between now and then and decided he likes the upside of Nano from here.  Maybe he just wants to get more Bitcoin, but either way it's pretty bullish that we are attracting those kinds of buys

I'm out guys. Won't be lurking around here anymore.
Who the fuck cares about crypto anymore, its a bunch of scammers and "investors" hoping new fools will come and buy their bags.
Crypto won't moon anytime soon, and if it does moon it will be in 10 years not sooner.
Crypto is nothing else but a database in the cloud that show's who owns how many coins, and coins them self are worthless.
Those that sold during last pump are lucky, others got fucked, that's just the way it is, some of us win, some of us lose... time to draw a line and cut the losses.
And this crypto space as a whole is pure bullshit, just look at the guys you have here, John McAfee, Carlos Matos, Charles Hoskinson, Colin LeMahieu fucking Bomber... scammer after scammer... its easier to find a scammer than a legit guy that leads development of a coin. It's all bullshit full of crocks and tricksters, no one sane will put their money into crypto. See you all in 10 or whatever years... will come back if I hear about crypto on the news again!

Alright here's an observation and a tinfoil hat theory.  In the last 3 days, the highest deposit into Binance's hot wallet is 10,000 Nano, which is relatively minor.  There is no evidence that any big whale is dumping from what I can tell.  So these literal MILLIONS of Nano that have been dumped in the last few days have already been on Binance.  I highly doubt any big whales are keeping their coins there and just decided to dump within the last few days.  Here's my tinfoil hat theory now...Because Binance holds such a monumental amount of Nano, they have the ability to manipulate the pricing and create pump and dumps any time they want.  I'm not saying they do this often, but the run from March 8 to April 22 could have been CZ's own internal trading team creating a FOMO run only to dump the fuck out of it over the next several days, earning shittons of BTC in the process.

I type d that tyitle twice because I knew it was wrong the first time. Still wrong. w/e. GF's out at a lesbian bar, NANO crashing WHY AM I HOLDING? I'LL TELL YOU WHY. It's because I'm a bad trader and I KNOW I'M A BAD TRADER. Yeah you good traders can spot the highs and the lows pit pat piffy wing wong wang just like that and make a millino bucks sure no problem bro. Likewise the weak hands are like OH NO IT'S GOING DOWN I'M GONNA SELL he he he and then they're like OH GOD MY ASSHOLE when the SMART traders who KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THEY'RE DOING buy back in but you know what? I'm not part of that group. When the traders buy back in I'm already part of the market capital so GUESS WHO YOU'RE CHEATING day traders NOT ME~! Those taunt threads saying "OHH YOU SHOULD HAVE SOLD" YEAH NO SHIT. NO SHIT I SHOULD HAVE SOLD. I SHOULD HAVE SOLD MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY SELL AND BOUGHT MOMENTS BEFORE EVERY BUY BUT YOU KNOW WHAT NOT EVERYBODY IS AS COOL AS YOU. You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day trader or an illusioned noob. The people inbetween hold. In a zero-sum game such as this, traders can only take your money if you sell.

so i've had some whiskey

actually on the bottle it's spelled whisky

This discord is a mental asylum for people who are so desperate to be rich that they'll convince themselves a -98% investment was still a good idea.

You will never find a more unstable set of people anywhere on the internet. One minute they are screaming because they've lost 25% of their portfolio in 3 minutes. The next minute they are congratulating themselves on buying more Nano despite doing nothing but lose money for 2 years.

These people are worse than gambling addicts, at least those guys get a profit sometimes.

As I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if NANO SPAMMERS do anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate their nodes (Iâ€™ve done it before!). They must, with Ty and others, watch over their dying shitcoins and communities. The Nano Foundation has done far more than anyone could have ever expected, including the capture of 100% of the Reddit Market . It is time now for others in the cryptosphere, some of great wealth, to invest in NANO. NANO IS GREAT!
