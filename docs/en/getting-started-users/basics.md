# Basics

## Nano is experimental & under development

Nano (XNO) is an experimental currency that is in active development. Each improvement makes Nano more appealing but can also reveal new challenges as it explores uncharted waters. While funds have never been lost due to the fault of the network, it is important to note that you may encounter slow or stalled confirmations, downtime, or other severe issues.

Nano's protocol will eventually mature to the point of being 'feature complete'. Currently, there exists a gap between Nano conceptually and operationally. Over time this gap will continue to close.

## Securing your account

As it is with physical money, digital money needs to be secured. If left unprotected or handled carelessly, it can be lost, stolen, or destroyed.

Nano can provide very high levels of security if used correctly. Learn how you can [secure your account](/getting-started-users/storing/basics), the network, and its value.

## Securing the network

Nano's network is secured by its holders through nodes that cast votes on behalf of them. Therefore, anyone in possession of Nano is responsible for safeguarding their voting weight and maintaining the network's decentralization.

Said another way, the security of the network relies on a shared understanding and commitment to maintaining decentralization and self-sovereignty based on a shared interest of maintaining the value of the network.

## Privacy

Nano puts you in control of your privacy. It then becomes your responsibility and choice when you reveal it.

All transactions are stored publicly and permanently on the network, which means anyone can see the balance and transactions of any account. However, the identity of the user behind an account remains unknown until a link is made to a known account through a transaction or in other circumstances. This is one reason why an account should only be used once. It is your responsibility to adopt good practices and use services that protect your privacy.

## Unconfirmed transactions

Most of the time, you may not notice unconfirmed transactions as they will settle before you can blink. At times, due to network congestion or poorly integrated services, you may have to wait for a transaction to become confirmed.

## Price volatility

The exchange rate for Nano can unpredictably increase or decrease over a short period of time due to its young economy, novel nature, and sometimes illiquid markets. Consequently, keeping your savings with Nano is not recommended at this point. Nano should be seen as a high-risk, asymmetric investment, and you should never store money that you cannot afford to lose with Nano.

## Taxes and regulation

Even though Nano is not officially recognized and regulated, most jurisdictions still require you to pay taxes on it. It is your responsibility to ensure that you adhere to tax and other legal or regulatory mandates issued by your government and/or local municipalities.
