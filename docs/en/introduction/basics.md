# Introduction

Nano (XNO) is a form of money that enables feeless, instant, and sustainable value transfer between anyone, anywhere in the world. Feeless meaning no value is lost during a transfer. It operates without intermediaries, using a distributed ledger with a unique block-lattice data structure collectively managed by a peer-to-peer network.

Nano was launched in October 2015 by Colin LeMahieu to address limitations in existing blockchain-based distributed ledgers. By allowing for scalability within the protocol and offering feeless transactions that typically achieve full confirmation in under one second, Nano is well suited to be a widely used base layer for settling value.
