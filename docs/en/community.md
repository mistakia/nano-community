# Communities

The largest communities are on reddit and discord.

- <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/" target="_blank">r/nanocurrency</a>: good for general discussions about nano, meeting community members, and following the ecosystem. It is the largest community.
- <a href="https://chat.nano.org/" target="_blank">Nano Discord</a>: used for coordination of beta testing, general discussions and support
- <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nanotrade" target="_blank">r/nanotrade</a>: home for price speculation, as it is discouraged most other places
- <a href="https://plasmapower.github.io/nanotrade/" target="_blank">NanoTrade Discord</a>: home for "Giga serious" discussion involving the cryptocurrency market
- <a href="https://github.com/nanocurrency" target="_blank">Nano GitHub Organization</a>: reference code repositories and documentation
