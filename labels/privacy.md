# Privacy

Privacy is an important and necessary part of digital money.

Because Nano uses a public pseudonymous ledger, further development is needed to lessen the burden on end-users as humans are error-prone and generally don't care about privacy until they do. Nano's pseudonymous ledger has the ingredients to allow for shielding your transaction history and accounts: infinite and free pseudonymous accounts with free transactions. To get an idea of how anonymity sets can be created on a public pseudonymous ledger check out the <a href="https://medium.com/samourai-wallet/diving-head-first-into-whirlpool-anonymity-sets-4156a54b0bc7" target="_blank">Samurai wallet</a> for bitcoin.

The advantage of achieving obfuscation/privacy with a pseudonymous ledger is a lighter, faster, and more scalable base protocol as layer one privacy proofs are bulky and require greater computation. In the meantime, follow these [best practices](/getting-started-users/privacy) to manage and protect your privacy.
