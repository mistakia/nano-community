**Topics**

Content can be tagged to a topic to allow for members to easily explore past discussions around a certain topic. Each topic will have a neutral, concise, and high-level summary along with supporting & opposing arguments, and links to all past comments. Topics exist to easily point new members to past conversations as new members will naturally think of things already discussed by past members.

    <summary>Nano Based Accounts & Voting</summary>

<br/>

Nano.Community accounts are a generated key-pair where the public key is signed by the private key pertaining to a nano account. This will allow associating a user's activity to an account on the nano network. The signing process will take place within a wallet (or on the commandline) and will not increase the risk/attack surface for a nano private key. This feature can be used to automate moderation of contributions as well as measuring support for or against certain proposals.
